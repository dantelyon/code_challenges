# code_challenges

My solutions to code challenges on Codewars.

I mostly do it to keep my algorithimc tinking sharp, and because i enjoy it.

Two major lessons learned from doing these kind of programming exercises:
a) Viewing others' solutions and code after submitting my own has really cemented the importance of
favoring /opting for readability and best practices over a clever oneliner
b) Made me more aware of not spending too much time trying to optmize the code (because of the pareto principle)
