# code_challenges

Some of my solutions to code challenges on Codewars.

I mostly do it to keep my algorithmic thinking sharp, and because I enjoy it.

Two valuable lessons from doing these kind of programming exercises:

a) Viewing others' solutions and code after submitting my own has cemented the importance of favoring readability and best practices over a clever one-liner.

b) Made me more aware of not spending too much time trying to optmize the code (because of the pareto principle).
