Some of my solutions to code challenges on Codewars.

I mostly do it to keep my algorithmic thinking sharp, and because I enjoy it.

Two valuable lessons I've learned from doing these kind of programming exercises:
* Seeing other's solutions and code after submitting my own has cemented the importance of favoring readability and best practices over a clever one-liner.
* Made me more aware of not spending too much time trying to optimize the code (because of the pareto principle).
